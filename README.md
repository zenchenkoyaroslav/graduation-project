# graduation-project

Arduino part of my graduation project

My graduation project theme was "Local action search engine development". 
It was android app + small device consisting of a speaker and a bluetooth adapter. 
An essence is as follows: android app connects to device and send an signal. 
After that device starts making sound. It is intended to hang the device, for example, on a key chain. 
Thus, the system allows using the phone to quickly find keys to people who often lose them. 
It can also be used for other small objects.

The device was made on the basis of Arduino nano.
The program was writen in C++. (File Deeplome.ino)
File Deeplome.DNS is a Proteus file with connection diagram.
